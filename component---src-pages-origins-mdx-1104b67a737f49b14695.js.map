Unlike roles and foci, which complement each other, you could swap origin cards out entirely and replace them with something else.

Do you want sea and sand elves, forest dwarves, cosmopolitan Shirefolk, subterranean humans? Go for it. Tell the table who lives in your region and what the world is like.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Point 2 is an attempt to subvert some of the implied racial stereotyping that comes with typical fantasy races. All elves tend toward agility, swordplay, and so on - really? If you grew up on bamboo catamarans, slicing through the blue waters between islands, would you have more or less in common with people from the mountainous north just because your ears are pointed like theirs?`}</p>\n    <p>{`It's possible that a species can be non-human `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`enough`}</em>{` to really outweigh its members' cultural background, but in that case it clearly deserves its own card, as an important part of the story.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Individual Origins`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Each of the origin cards is something of a stereotype. However, each card also comes with a specific flipside condition: \"subvert the stereotype\". There's an expectation that people will always play against type to some degree.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are two groups of origin cards: people from the North, South, East, and West, and people from the City, Country, Forest, and Scraplands. It's possible for someone to be from, for example, a chilly city in the far northern mountains and still be a City Folk. When in doubt, pick the origin card that you feel will most strongly represent your PC.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Of these regions, only the Scraplands deserves special mention. Many fantasy settings have a \"precursor\" or \"ancient\" culture that destroyed itself. Others have a history of destructive wars or plagues. The \"Scraplands\" is the generic term for any region that has been affected by such past catastrophe, and Scraplanders are those who dwell in such places. They are intended to be scavengers and packrats, taking chances but also doing interesting things with the stuff they find in the ruins they visit.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
