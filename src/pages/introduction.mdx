# Introduction to Flip-a-Card

Some of this might find its way onto some core-rule cards, if it's not already there.

## The basics

* The game is built out of 3x5 or 4x6 index cards, together called a deck
* Cards have two sides: a top side (generally advantageous to the players) and a flip side (generally not)
* Many rules will involve flipping a card between one side and the other
* Individual cards have rules, writing prompts, and indicative symbols on one or both sides
* Specific cards might call for other props, like dice or tokens
* The cards are meant to help a group of people lay out a fun fictional adventure
* The cards are meant to supply all the typical elements of an RPG (character stats, combat rules, etc.)

## Creating new cards

* The cards here are examples, meant to inspire
* That said, they should be usable as they are - that's the point
* During play, players are encouraged to write their own cards as needed
* Whether a newly created card should enter play or not is a table decision

## Using cards

* Individual cards are either "in play" or not
* All players are bound by the rules of all cards in play
* It's understood that cards placed on a table (or similar play area) are "in play"
* Cards leave play by being discarded, either by a card rule or table consensus

## The reference deck

* The reference deck includes four types of cards
  * core rules
  * character cards - cards that together make a player character
  * condition cards - temporary stuff like "you're injured"
  * encounter cards - monsters, encounters, scenery, and more
* Characters are built by choosing three character cards, one each from the different sub-types (e.g. origin, role, focus)
* Characters confront challenges and meet them by getting hits from rules on other cards
* In practice, this means if you have to meet a challenge, you can:
  * Flip an appropriate character card, by narrating how that facet of yourself is useful
  * Take a condition card, or aggravate an existing one
  * Find a way to leverage an encounter card
