# Playing the Soldier

The [Soldier](/cards/soldier) is the warrior, the champion, the pillar of strength. They are also the muscle, the bully, the heartless.

The Soldier is going on a grand adventure to _find good uses for violence_. Their life is about fighting, and the moments between battles are either peaceful too briefly, or filled with preparation for the next struggle. Ideally, whatever bad things are going on could be dealt with peacefully. But often they can't, and that's when a Soldier is needed.

### The Soldier's Life

The Soldier's three topside prompts are:

- Test your fate against an opponent
- Make a sacrifice to support a hope
- Stand up when everything says to stay down

A Soldier lays their safety and security on the line to achieve a goal. Sometimes that goal is personal - to find out who's stronger, or better, or just to see how far they can push themselves. Other times, someone or something has to be stopped, and the Soldier isn't allowed to give up until that happens. Maybe they won't get anything out of it but the smiles of the grateful. But sometimes, that's enough.

The Soldier's three flipside prompts are:

- Lash out at an easy target
- Use your power selfishly
- Lose faith in peace

It's so, so tempting to give up. For anyone else, that would mean avoiding conflict. For a Soldier, it can mean giving up on the right way to achieve goals. They might vent their frustrations on people weaker than them, or turn bully, getting what they want through strength. Sometimes the Soldier forgets that other ways are even possible, and decides that _somebody_ is going to pay for _something_.

### The Soldier's Focus

_"Where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence." -- Mohandas Gandhi_

Soldiers with **Courage** are warriors, standing up on the front lines and fearlessly confronting adversaries. They do it for any number of reasons, whether good cause or just plain fun. Example: the classic fighter.

_"Besides we are men, and after all it is our business to risk our lives." -- Alexandre Dumas, "The Three Musketeers"_

Soldiers with **Charm** are duelists, swashbucklers, and bravoes. While they might follow a code, or rakishly disregard polite convention, they face struggle with a grin. Example: the Musketeer.

_"Violence isn't always evil. What's evil is the infatuation with violence." -- Jim Morrison_

Soldiers with **Chi** develop themselves physically and mentally, seeing challenge as a crucible in which they are reforged. Example: a martial artist.

_"If you're afraid - don't do it, - if you're doing it - don't be afraid!" - Genghis Khan_

Soldiers with **Instinct** can be berserkers, blood knights, or just people with hair triggers. Something inside them tells them to fight. What they must decide is when and why. Example: the barbarian.

_"We know our weakness. Now what will we do? We'll get stronger! We'll get up and fight!" - Natsu Dragneel, "Fairy Tail"_

Soldiers with **Magic** are sorcerers or martial clerics, who might wield weapons as ably as they command spells. Their power is overt, a mixture of help and harm, barriers and burning blades. Example: Fire-Mages.

_"We work in the dark to serve the light." - "Assassin's Creed"_

Soldiers with **Secrets** fight with hidden weapons, using concealment, ambush, and trickery to get the drop on enemies. Why they fight is sometimes the biggest secret they keep. Example: the assassin.

_"Conquering evil, not the opponent, is the essence of swordsmanship." -- YagyÅ« Munenori_

Soldiers with **Tech** understand that while weapons can harm, and peace is preferable, sometimes you need the one to defend the other. They work with anything from a bow and arrow to magitech firearms, using the science of war as their strength. Example: the archer.

_"Every battle is won or lost before it's ever fought" - Sun Tzu, "The Art of War"_

Soldiers with **Wits** know the value of position, maneuver, and tactics. Some strive for a bloodless victory, forcing the enemy to see and acknowledge their own defeat. Others arrange for enemies to defeat themselves. Example: the warlord.
