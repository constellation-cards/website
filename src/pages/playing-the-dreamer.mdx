# Playing the Dreamer

The [Dreamer](/cards/dreamer) is the idealist, the free-thinker, the ambitious youth. They are also the foolish, the naive, the hopeless.

The Dreamer is going on a grand adventure to _bring change to the world_. Something is wrong, even if that something is "things aren't as good as they could be". But usually, something is very wrong. There's an evil force at work, or a wrong that needs righting, or a disaster waiting to happen. When people see the Dreamer approach this problem and ask, "who called you to do this?", the Dreamer's answer is "my heart".

### The Dreamer's Life

The Dreamer's three topside prompts are:

- Remind someone of their best self
- Light a candle to spite the darkness
- Defy what's possible with what's necessary

These paint the role as a character who can serve as an inspiration to other people. They themselves aren't enough - but no one person ever is. They serve as a magnet for others to glom onto, a rallying point around which a critical mass of people can form.

Why does this work? Because people need reminders of what could be. We emulate and idolize each other in our daily lives, and we draw strength from seeing others push forward. When we forget what we're capable of, sometimes it just takes a supporting hand to pull us up and out, and keep us moving behind them.

The Dreamer's three flipside prompts are:

- Reject the real, denounce the realist
- Forget that you have friends
- Lose sight of your dream for a time

At the same time, the weight of the work facing the Dreamer can sometimes be too much. Their ideal world, and the harsh reality of their real world, tug at them. Sometimes the strain is too much, and something has to give. Is it the dreams - or one's sense of reality?

To survive this crisis, Dreamers sometimes need their own supporting hand, from someone they've inspired in the past. When they're ready to remember what they're working toward, they can get up and keep moving again.

### The Dreamer's Focus

_"You cannot swim for new horizons until you have courage to lose sight of the shore." - William Faulkner_

Dreamers with **Courage** are culture heroes and folk-song characters. They charge in, larger than life, to wrestle the bear or confront the villain or whatever is needed next. Example: The knight's squire.

_"Pursuing your passions makes you more interesting, and interesting people are enchanting." -- Guy Kawasaki_

Dreamers with **Charm** inspire with words and grace, or just enthusiasm. People want to follow them because of their charisma. They surround themselves with useful associates and keep them motivated. Example: The plucky heroine.

_"To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities." - Bruce Lee_

Dreamers with **Chi** are full of youth and potential. They know there's something out there worth fighting and suffering for. Their pursuit of excellence motivates them to perfect the rest of the world. Example: the old master's pupil.

_"Top heroes have stories about them from their school days. Most of their stories have one thing in common: their bodies moved before they had a chance to think." -- All Might, "My Hero Academia"_

Dreamers with **Instinct** don't _know_ what's needed, they just _do_ it. They can be chronic heroes, always rushing into things, or just people who blurt out helpful (if weird) words of encouragement. Example: the free spirit.

_"I'll work hard to become a witch who can make everyone smile. Because to me, magic is the most wonderful thing in the entire world!" -- Atsuko Kagari, "Little Witch Academia"_

Dreamers with **Magic** feel the awe and wonder of power. They might be novice sorcerers who chafe at their mentor's strict rules, or spellcasters whose successes are few but whose failures are far more productive.

_"Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes." - Carl Jung_

Dreamers with **Secrets** know something important, something nobody else knows, and this drives them to do, and learn. The overlord's true weakness, the location of the old artifact, the true identity of the prince - any of these can be the key to victory. Example: the prophet.

_Gilgamesh Wulfenbach: ...A coffee shop? What is she doing in a coffee shop?  
Captain Vole: She iz making coffee, sir.  
Gilgamesh Wulfenbach: Making coffee...  
Captain Vole: Dere haff been three explosions so far, sir.  
Gilgamesh Wulfenbach: Agatha! -- "Girl Genius"_

Dreamers with **Tech** are going to build the future. Through science, alchemy, or whatever discipline they pursue, they inspire and improve the world around them. Example: the gadgeteer kid.

_Hiccup: Three hundred years and I'm the first Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.  
Astrid: ...First to ride one, though. -- "How to Train Your Dragon"_

Dreamers with **Wits** are clever, but in the service to some greater ideal. They dodge obstacles, rather than getting bogged down. They turn enemies into allies, or challenges into opportunities. Example: the underdog.
