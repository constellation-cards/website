# Playing the Synthesist

The [Synthesist](/cards/synthesist) is the "creative". They are leaders, planners, organizers, makers. Given pieces, they make a working whole. Given clues, they solve a mystery. Given a problem, they provide a solution. Give individuals, they make a team.

The Synthesist is going on a grand adventure to _rearrange the world for the better_. Their ability to organize or create gives them a chance to put broken things back together.

### The Synthesist's Life

The Synthesist's three topside prompts are:

- Make something new out of what's available
- Repair or recreate something
- Bring creativity to bear against a problem

Gadgets, relationships, logic puzzles - whatever their specialty, the Synthesist is about plugging things together in new or useful ways. They see connections, possibilities, potentials. A social Synthesist can mend friendships or introduce the right people to each other. A military Synthesist can use the terrain, weather, and even the enemy's own plan to gain victory.

The Synthesist's three flipside prompts are:

- Tear down something valuable or important
- Keep something going at great cost
- Overuse the same solution

You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. Sometimes what the Synthesist needs isn't available, and they have to make do - or cannibalize something else. Seeing to a friend's needs while neglecting someone else, salvaging vital metals from the village's supply, or finishing the occult containment circle with your own blood are all prices one might pay. Other times, a synthesist falls into a rut, re-using a solution or tactic and hence becoming predictable - or running out of a vital resource.

### The Synthesist's Focus

_"We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down." -- Kurt Vonnegut_

Synthesists with **Courage** will push at a dangerous situation until it fractures, then put the pieces back together in a better way. Example: the military commander.

_"If you need something from somebody always give that person a way to hand it to you." -- Sue Monk Kidd, "The Secret Life of Bees"_

Synthesists with **Charm** are leaders and organizers. By getting people talking and sharing, they let good ideas blossom into reality. Example: the diplomat.

_"The more you sweat in training, the less you bleed in combat" -- Richard Marcinko_

_Felicity: Please tell me you have a brilliant plan._
_Oliver: I don't even have a regular plan. -- "Arrow"_

_"It's still magic even if you know how it's done." -- Terry Pratchett_

Synthesists with **Magic** are artificers or alchemists who build, enchant, or mix together mystic wonders. Spellcasters dedicated to combining elements or arcane components into new creations also qualify.
