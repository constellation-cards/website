# Flip-a-Card

## Quickstart

1. **Decide on who gets which role cards**. Remember that these cards can change hands later! Your goal is to get started building the game you're going to play.
   - There are four "GM" roles: **Facilitator**, **Loremaster**, **Storyteller**, and **Referee**. These roles can all go to the same person, if you want. No more than one person can hold any of these roles, however.
   - The **Principal** role lets you create a Principal Character (PC). Any or all players can take this role.
   - It is advised that the Storyteller and Facilitator not take the Principal role, unless the group is small.
2. **Perform the world and character creation steps in any order**. You can also go back and forth, doing some or all of them at the same time, to let inspiration take its course. Each of these steps can be discussed as a group, but the GM roles have the final say.
   - The **Referee** decides which cards are allowed in play, and which rule cards to play immediately.
   - The **Loremaster** decides on a genre and tone for the game - urban fantasy, high-magic adventure, etc.
   - The **Storyteller** decides on one or two campaign issues, such as "dark magic" or "human monarchy", that will give the game a starting point.
   - The **Facilitator** guides any Principals through creating their PCs, asking driving questions and encouraging collaboration as needed.
3. The **Facilitator** asks each Principal to explain their PC's position on each issue ("I'm curious about dark magic", "the human kingdoms are a threat to my people").
4. **Discuss why the PCs are in a group together**. Establish relationships between PCs, using the campaign issues as guidance.
5. The **Storyteller** establishes an initial encounter for the PCs to engage with, and the game begins.
