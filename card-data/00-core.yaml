      Several core rules are roles assigned to a single player.
      These roles can be assigned individually to several people, or all given to a single player ("the Game Master" or "the GM").
      The roles can change hands during the game. You cannot take a role away from someone else, but you can ask someone else to give up a role.
      If you've been assigned a role, you are bound by the Principles.

      You get to create and play a Principal Character (PC), one of the protagonists of the story.
      Your job is to narrate your character's actions and reactions. Decide on their agendas, then enact them in interesting ways.
      When someone asks "what does your character do, say, or think?", you get to answer.
    prompts:
      - Stay true to your character
      - Share ways for other players to help you have fun
      - Look for opportunities to advance your story
      - Support other players' stories

      Players in the spotlight are the focus of narration. We're asking them for an action that pushes the scene forward, and shining the spotlight until they make one.
      Your job is to move the spotlight from player to player in fun and fair ways. Any player can call for the spotlight to move, but you have the final say when it does.
      Move the spotlight:
    prompts:
      - toward a PC who's placed at risk or in danger
      - toward a player who hasn't acted recently
      - toward a player who has an interesting idea for how to move things forward
      - away from a player who just resolved a dramatic or decisive action
      - away from a cliffhanger or moment of tension
      - away from any player who's had it too long

      Your job is to establish the history, setting, and canon of the world in which the game happens.
      When someone asks, "what do our characters know about X?" and it's not a question for an Ensemble Character (EC) to decide, you get to answer.
      Any player can suggest an answer, but you have the final say on what's true. If a specific PC's heritage, origin, or interests concern the question, consider deferring to them.
    prompts:
      - Who was the greatest Paladin in history?
      - What languages might my character learn to speak?
      - When did the dragons disappear?
      - How does magic work, anyway?
      - Why are orcs monotheistic?

      Your job is to adjudicate questions about the rules of the game, and to make changes to the rules with the group's consent. Any player can suggest how to handle a rule, but you have the final say.
      Example rulings:
    prompts:
      - Is a given card applicable to this fictional situation?
      - How should a given card's text be interpreted?
      - Is it time to create a new card?

      The Principal Characters (PCs) are the focus of the game. The game also has Ensemble Characters (ECs), sometimes called Non-Player Characters (NPCs).
      Your job is to narrate the ECs' actions and reactions. Decide on their agendas, then enact them in interesting ways.
      ECs are allies, antagonists, or anyone else involved in the story but not at the heart of it.
    prompts:
      - Give ECs a name and identity
      - Find the essential humanity of every EC
      - Don't steal agency or spotlight from the PCs
      - Initiate actions that prompt a PC response

      If any player thinks the outcome of your narration is uncertain, they can challange you.

      "I'd like your help. Your help to make this game fun for everyone. If anything makes anyone uncomfortable in any way, just lift this card up, or simply tap it. You don't have to explain why. It doesn't matter why. When we lift or tap this card, we simply edit out anything X-Carded."
      "And if there is ever an issue, anyone can call for a break and we can talk privately. I know it sounds funny but it will help us play amazing games together and usually I'm the one who uses the X card to protect myself from all of you! Please help make this game fun for everyone. Thank you!"
