      //"Welcome to the Labri Market! You can find anything here." -- Basler

      You grew up among markets and traders,
      whether in a populated city or on the road with a caravan.
      You've seen people from all over, and have heard
      or can even speak multiple languages.

      You've learned to approach situations via negotiation.
    prompts:
      - Make a deal or haggle over details
      - Navigate a physical or social labyrinth
      - Gauge someone's wants or needs

      //"...For the right price." -- Basler

      Not everything can be reduced to a simple transaction,
      but some people can't see any other way.
      It becomes easy to ignore pain and devalue life
      when money or power become a cocoon against existence.
    prompts:
      - Compromise a principle or ideal for expedience
      - Overcomplicate a plan or solution
      - Look past pain or hurt rather than soothe it
- front: &Industrious
    <<: *tfront
    name: Industrious

      //"Take a deep breath of that farm air!" -- Tana

      You grew up among farmers, trappers, city laborers,
      or other folk who made their way by the sweat of their brow.
      Others expected you to carry your own weight.
      Life could be routine, and you learned ways
      to pass the time.

      You've learned to approach situations via effort.
    prompts:
      - Be sensitive to natural rhythms around you
      - Make do with what's on hand
      - Coordinate with others to get hard work done

      //"Smells like cow breakfast" -- Basler

      Not everyone appreciates the necessity of hard work.
      But sometimes, just plowing through isn't the right answer either.
      You're used to getting down in the mud,
      but it's important to reach for the stars as well.
    prompts:
      - Work harder, not smarter
      - Sacrifice tomorrow's hopes for today's needs
      - Lay a heavy burden on light shoulders
- front: &Insular

      //"This is all very different from the cloister" -- Emory

      You grew up secluded from the rest of the world.
      Whether you lived on a lonely mountain village,
      a religious retreat, or in an enclave within a
      city, the ways of the outside world are a mystery.

      You've learned to approach situations through curiosity.
    prompts:
      - Solve a problem using your peoples' ways
      - Ask naive but insightful questions
      - Reveal hidden knowledge or exclusive experience
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Insular

      //"Everything's different out here. That's why it's called a cloister" -- Basler

      Your early life didn't prepare you for the sheer
      variey of people and things the world has to offer.
      You might make a basic blunder, or ask a troubling question.
      When in doubt, there might be someone you rely on for answers,
      or you may rely on your upbringing's incomplete picture of things.
    prompts:
      - Violate unspoken rules or cultural taboos
      - Cause conflict through misunderstanding
      - Fall back on a trusted authority
- front: &Noble
    <<: *tfront
    name: Noble
    desc: >
      //"Knights should be glorious champions of honor!" -- Emory

      Your family might be Old Money,
      or the most valuable thing you have is an old name.
      Things are done just so, with elegance and refinement.
      You hold a high station, and expectations of you
      are equally high.
      Otherwise, what is the point of you?

      You've learned to approach situations through protocol.
    prompts:
      - Do what is right and proper, no matter what
      - Hold others to a high standard
      - Leverage your power and authority
  back:
    <<: *tback

      //"As opposed to ironclad thugs lording it over the peasants?" -- Basler

      Not everyone benefits from, or approves of,
      a system of aristocracy or nobility.
      People might assume you look down on them,
      or that you'll abuse the power you hold.
      And all too often, they'll be right.
    prompts:
      - Mire a situation in pomp and etiquette
      - Demand sacrifices you haven't made
      - Lord it over your perceived lessers
- front: &Nomadic
    <<: *tfront

      //"The clear skies, the lure of the open road, it's perfect!" -- Tana

      You grew up traveling, whether with family or other companions.
      You've visited many communities, seen many interesting sights,
      and heard many fascinating tales.
      These experiences let you understand and embrace difference.

      You've learned to approach situations through openness.
    prompts:
      - Recall a story that will bring people together or solutions to light
      - Bring a fresh perspective to a situation
      - Forge a path to acceptance or compromise
  back:
    <<: *tback

      //"Do these wagon wheels fall off often?" -- Emory

      Life on the road is never easy.
      It can be tempting to avoid responsibility
      or relationships through an early departure.
      It's also easy to mistake your breadth of
      experience for depth, and fail to hear
      wiser voices.
    prompts:
      - Overestimate your own wisdom or experiences
      - Leave a half-solved problem behind and move on
      - See people as faces in the crowd, not individuals
- front: &Solitary
    <<: *tfront

      //"I got this, leave me alone" -- Woody

      For much of your life, you've been on your own.
      You might have been orphaned or abandoned or kidnapped.
      You might have run away from home,
      or home might no longer exist.

      You've learned to approach situations through isolation.
    prompts:
      - Shut out distractions
      - Present a reassuring facade
      - Keep moving even when hope is lost
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Solitary
    desc: >
      //"You've left yourself alone too long" -- Tana

      Without experiencing what other people in your life
      can do, you may fear what you need most from them:
      an outlet.
      When you act distant, others will reciprocate.
    prompts:
      - Accumulate emotional debt
      - Keep your reservations unspoken
      - Leave others behind to fend for themselves
- front: &Underclass
    <<: *tfront
    name: Underclass

      //"Nobody fights for people like us. So we fight for ourselves." -- Basler
      
      You grew up among people who were neglected or rejected
      by a surrounding society.
      Your family or neighbors could have been criminals, migrants,
      members of a disliked minority or species, or anything else.

      You've learned to approach situations via pride.
    prompts:
      - Stand up for yourself and those like you
      - Rally those who question themselves
      - Obtain your needs through a social network

      //"When everyone hates you, it's hard not to hate them back." -- Basler

      Sometimes, circumstances push people to a breaking point.
      Other times, doing the right thing becomes impossible,
      and you're left with doing the necessary thing.
    prompts:
      - Lash out at threats to your ego
      - Build yourself up in the eyes of the impressionable
      - Run afoul of those in power
