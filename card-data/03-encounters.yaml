      //"My daggers bounced off that plate mail! What now?" -- Basler
      
      This encounter includes something important that is heavily defended.
      
      The defense could be literal armor-- a crafted barrier of metal, stone, leather, wood, or the like.
      
      It could also be a protective aura of magic, a divine blessing, or a natural body or structure made of
      something tough.
      
      No matter what form it takes, the armor defends against specific kinds of damage.
      
      When you play this card describe the defenses and what they affect. 
      You may be challenged if you try to penetrate or circumvent the armor to get to what's inside.
      
      Something armored may:
    prompts:
      - Ignore harm from typical weapons or other sources of harm
      - Destroy weaker things that strike it or are struck by it
      - Protect unarmored allies
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Armored
    desc: >
      //"You know what metal does? Heats up. Fireball!" -- Tana
      
      Armor must have a weakness or some kind of cost.
      
      Armoring something often reduces some other characteristic, such as nimbleness or speed.
      Some armor is particularly weak to something, or has a specific weak spot.
      Other armor requires effort or resources to maintain.
      
      You can confront an Armored obstacle without a challenge
      if you can find and exploit one of these weaknesses.
      
      Something armored may:
    prompts:
      - Have limited senses that can be exploited by nimble, stealthy, or evasive opponents
      - Be forced to shed the armor if it's heated, if they sink, etc.
      - Be susceptible to area-effect attacks or those of a particular type (magic, psychic, electric, etc.)
- front: &Base
    <<: *tfront
    name: Base
    desc: >
      //"Aheheh.. We come in peace?" -- Basler
      
      The encounter includes a place where creatures stay for a common purpose.
      
      A Base is a temporary encampment, an outpost,
      a secret headquarters, a wild animal's den, or something like it.
      
      You may be challenged if you try to find something specific in the base, find your way out or through,
      or confront its occupants and their preparations.
      
      A Base may:
    prompts:
      - Bristle with defenders
      - Defy intrusion with traps, labyrinthine structure, or other clever preparations
      - Enable its defenders to cut off escape routes or easily give chase
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Base
    desc: >
      //"Next time, I'll let my sword do the talking." -- Emory
      
      While Bases can be big and imposing,
      their nature can work against their occupants.
      
      Tents, side-passages, stacked crates,
      and many other things can help a character even the odds.
      Camps have a lot of supplies that can be looted or bargained for.
      
      A Base may:
    prompts:
      - House something you're looking for, or something unexpected that can help you
      - Rely on infrastructure that can be destroyed or disrupted
      - Give up secrets about the plans and activities of its occupants
- front: &Diabolical
    <<: *tfront
    name: Diabolical
    desc: >
      //"Back, foul fiend! Light will overcome you!" -- Emory
      
      A Diabolical encounter has the touch of evil.
      An actual summoned demon, a possessed victim,
      or a dark and malevolent force are all Diabolic.

      You may be challenged if you engage with the Diabolical without proper protections or if you unknowingly
      encounter its influence.
      
      A Diabolical encounter may:
    prompts:
      - Seek to corrupt or influence the vulnerable
      - Exploit moral weaknesses or dark secrets
      - Reveal hellish powers
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Diabolical
    desc: >
      //"Basler, stop cringing. He's not talking about you." -- Woody
      
      Evil hasn't won, though it keeps trying.
      Powers from beyond are bound by their own rules too,
      and can be defeated accordingly.

      Characters who arm themselves with occult lore or divine blessing may circumvent or neutralize
      a Diabolical power.
      
      A Diabolical encounter may:
    prompts:
      - Be susceptible to folk incantations or rituals
      - Recoil affrightedly from the pure of heart
      - Flee to fight another day
- front: &Elemental
    <<: *tfront
    name: Elemental
    desc: >
      //"Earth sprites. They have the ore we seek." -- Tana
      
      The being is composed of, infused with,
      or can manipulate a common element.
      
      The classical elements are Air (or Wind), Earth, Fire, or Water (or Ice).
      Lightning, Darkness, Holy (or Light), and others, might also be included.
      
      Confronting an Elemental being may pose a challenge,
      especially when close to its native element.
      
      Elemental beings may:
    prompts:
      - Create, move, or manipulate their element in useful or dangerous ways
      - Embody the qualities of the element, such as flowing like water or burning like fire
      - Draw strength from sources of the element
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Elemental
    desc: >
      //"They had some nice gemstones too!" -- Basler
      
      Being tied to an element means being bound to it too.
      
      An Elemental being is often subject to extra restrictions,
      whether magical or based on the element,
      like a fire spirit being weak to water.
      Being Elemental does not pose a challenge if so bound.
      
      Elemental beings may:
    prompts:
      - Be vulnerable to their element's normal vulnerabilities or rules
      - Require a nearby source of the element to control, or just to survive
- front: &Flying
    <<: *tfront
    name: Flying
    desc: >
      //"Did something just swoop overhead?" -- Emory
      
      The being can fly through the air.
      
      Winged creatures, masters of the element of air,
      or skilled magicians could all fly.
      Since most people cannot,
      this gives them a great advantage over those trapped on the ground.
      
      Reaching this being while in the air may pose a challenge.
      
      Flying beings may:
    prompts:
      - Strike targets on the ground without risking counterattacks
      - Move faster than ground-based beings, or reach places they can't
      - See greater distances or from better angles
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Flying
    desc: >
      //"Meet my best girl, Annette! A net, get it?" -- Basler
      
      Flight often comes with drawbacks or complications of its own.
      
      Winged beings often require more energy to sustain flight,
      and cannot carry much weight.
      Magical or elemental sources of flight can be counterspelled or negated.
      And a target that can fly but does not is not safe.
      
      Flying beings may:
    prompts:
      - Become entangled, trapped, or confined in ways that negate flight
      - Be unable to lift heavy loads or fly under difficult conditions
      - Suffer great harm if they fall a great distance
- front: &Gang
    <<: *tfront
    name: Gang
    desc: >
      //"They outnumber us 5 to 1, folks!" -- Basler
      
      A Gang is made up of several similar individuals.
      
      Gangs can be encountered while traveling, guarding territory, or just being social together.

      A Gang may pose a challenge if confronted as a group.
      
      A Gang may:
    prompts:
      - Surround or isolate individuals through strength in numbers
      - Shout down or bully a lone voice
      - Bring a variety of skills or resources to bear on a problem
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Gang
    desc: >
      //"Sounds like fair odds to me. Have at you!" -- Emory
      
      A gang is powerful because it's made up of many people.
      But people are still individuals.
      If they change their minds or feel confusion,
      the Gang may not pose a challenge.
      
      A Gang may:
    prompts:
      - Have mixed sympathies or agendas
      - Fall apart if a leader is weakened or shamed
      - Rally around a new cause if forcefully presented
- front: &Hybrid
    <<: *tfront
    name: Hybrid
    desc: >
      //"A Gryphon. The heraldic symbol of my kingdom. Majestic!" -- Emory

      A Hybrid being is made up of two or more things, not always living.
      
      Such beings can be part-human (mermaids, harpies),
      mixed animal (cockatrices, pegasi),
      shapeshifters (werewolves), or weirder (tree-ogres).

      A Hybrid may pose a challenge if characters are unfamiliar with the combination.
      
      Hybrid beings may:
    prompts:
      - Use the best of their combined abilities
      - Use different abilities together in some unique way
      - Reveal a surprising new ability
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Hybrid
    desc: >
      //"That thing was terrifying! Your kingdom is messed up!" -- Basler
      
      Not every hybrid has a perfect command of its own nature.
      Hybrids must also obey the rules of all their component parts.

      A Hybrid may not pose a challenge if the characters exploit its weaknesses.
      
      Hybrid beings may:
    prompts:
      - Suffer the vulnerabilities of any of their contributing parts
      - Become confused by conflicting impulses or instincts
- front: &Large
    <<: *tfront
    name: Large
    desc: >
      //"The bigger they are, the harder they fall!" -- Tana
      
      The encounter is enormous in size.
      It might be naturally large, like a dragon or a giant,
      or have been ensorcelled or otherwise altered.

      A Large encounter may pose a challenge if the difference in scale is not overcome.
      
      A Large encounter may:
    prompts:
      - Resist human-scale attacks or effects
      - Reach or hit an entire area at once
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Large
    desc: >
      //"Just as long as it doesn't fall on us." -- Basler
      
      A regular group can have trouble engaging with a Large encounter
      due to the size difference, but that trouble goes both ways.
      A Large encounter may not pose a challenge if characters
      exploit their respective sizes somehow.
      
      A Large encounter may:
    prompts:
      - Lose track of small details or targets
      - Be easily targeted due to its size
      - Move slowly or clumsily
- front: &Monstrous
    <<: *tfront
    name: Monstrous
    desc: >
      //"That ain't no ordinary wolf, folks.." -- Basler
      
      Monstrous beings are altered somehow.
      They are fiercer, more feral, physically or mentally unnatural.
      
      A Monstrous creature can be stronger or tougher,
      or might have other features.
      Beasts might have longer talons, scales or thicker hide,
      an extra-large jaw, and so on.
      
      A Monstrous being poses a challenge
      when you aren't familiar with its adaptions or uniqueness.
      
      Monstrous beings can:
    prompts:
      - Lash out savagely at threats
      - Use their adaptions to overwhelm the unprepared
      - Terrify onlookers with their awful nature
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Monstrous
    desc: >
      //"Whoever corrupted this creature will pay. Let's press on." -- Woody
      
      A Monstrous creature's own nature can be its undoing,
      but such stories never end well.
      
      Monstrous creatures often lack a sense of self-preservation
      that would cause any ordinary specimen to retreat
      when things become too dangerous, and will press an attack unto death.
      
      Monstrous beings can:
    prompts:
      - Lose themselves in their own ferocity
      - Fall back before an unyielding defense or determined counterattack
- front: &Notorious
    <<: *tfront
    name: Notorious
    desc: >
      //"That's Gretamaw, the Beaked Butcher!" -- Basler
      
      Notorious beings are well known for something, whether true deeds or exaggerated stories.
      
      A Notorious monster might be a man-hunter,
      given a name by fearful villagers, or just something with a unique trait.
      Notorious people may deserve their reputation,
      or been given one they don't necessarily live up to.
      
      Notorious beings always have names. What is the name of this one?
      
      Notorious beings may:
    prompts:
      - Impress or intimidate you with their presence
      - Live up to the legend in a big way
      - Reveal some unexpected or unreported ability
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Notorious
    desc: >
      //"Save the beak. We need it to claim the reward!" -- Basler
      
      Fame has its price.
      If the stories that have gotten around are accurate,
      you might know how to take on this encounter - maybe.
      Other people might show up too, some who want to help you,
      or perhaps rival hunters or fortune-seekers.
      
      Notorious beings may:
    prompts:
      - Act in predictable or expected ways
      - Draw unwanted attention to themselves in the region
      - Alter the reputation of those who interact with them
- front: &Ominous
    <<: *tfront
    name: Ominous
    desc: >
      //"Where are all those crows going?" -- Tana

      The encounter portends something else.
      It can be a mystical experience, laden with dreams and prophecy,
      or just a mundane glimpse into a momentous reality beyond.

      Ominous encounters not only foretell change,
      but confront a character with a question:
      are you ready for what comes next?

      Ominous encounters may:
    prompts:
      - Give a taste of things to come
      - Force people into hard moral or personal choices
      - Subtly mingle the mundane and the dreamlike
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Ominous
    desc: >
      //"They're going the same way we are. Come on." -- Woody
      
      The Ominous is the first step on a larger road.
      It both surprises characters, and prepares them for what is next.

      Ominous encounters may not pose a challenge
      when the characters accept what is to come.
      
      Ominous encounters may:
    prompts:
      - Reveal an important clue or suggest a strategy
      - Unlock a hidden strength or personal conviction
- front: &Spectral
    <<: *tfront
    name: Spectral
    desc: >
      //"My arrows go right through it." -- Woody

      A Spectral encounter is ghostly,
      whether an actual ghost or something removed from regular reality.

      A ghost or astral projection has
      obligations or passions holding it to the real world.
      Other spectres, such as living beings under a curse,
      might wish to be material again and may
      bargain or threaten to achieve that.

      A Spectral encounter may pose a challenge
      if people have no way of interacting with it.
    prompts:
      - Pass selectively through solid matter or people
      - Wield morbid magics like chilling touches or possession
      - Ravenously pursue something the living have that it wants
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Spectral
    desc: >
      //"I'll have a magic circle up in a moment!" -- Tana

      Spectral beings came to the waking world for a reason,
      whether for mischief, malice, or other needs.
      The bonds holding them to life are tenuous,
      and if they're given what they want, or can
      no longer get it, they might be forced back.

      Spectral encounter may not pose a challenge if
      their objective is obtained, threatened, or destroyed.
    prompts:
      - Disappear back into the other world
      - Be weakened or repulsed by warding rituals
      - Make a compromise to achieve its objective
- front: &Tense
    <<: *tfront
    name: Tense
    desc: >
      //"Deep breaths. Stay calm. Show them we're friends." -- Tana

      A Tense being is one who is willing to interact peacefully,
      but is ready to fight or flee.

      Tense people can be negotiated with, but carefully.
      They're on alert for a reason. What is it?
      Other kinds of creatures can be approached,
      maybe offered something they want like food, but they will be wary.

      Keeping a Tense being from bolting or attacking may pose a challenge.

      Tense beings may:
    prompts:
      - Demonstrate fear, anger, or mistrust
      - Compel a concession or compromise from the group
      - Distract someone from an impending danger
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Tense
    desc: >
      //"You mean the real villain all this time was...?!" -- Emory
      
      Tension is resolved in good or bad ways.
      Either way, it's possible to glimpse the reason for the tension.
      
      Perhaps a mother dragon was guarding her nest.
      Perhaps the strange peddler was the King's spy.
      Whatever is really going on,
      you might never have learned about it if not for this encounter.
      
      Tense beings may:
    prompts:
      - Reveal a deceit or misunderstanding
      - Build or break trust
- front: &Venomous
    <<: *tfront
    name: Venomous
    desc: >
      //"Don't let it touch you! Your skin will rot away!" -- Woody

      The being has a toxic quality that makes it dangerous to engage with.

      Frogs and toads, insects, spiders, snakes, scorpions,
      and beings based on them, may all be naturally deadly.
      Dishonorable fighters such as assassins might make use of poisons,
      usually on bladed weapons.

      Avoiding harm while fighting a Venomous being may pose a challenge.

      Venomous beings may:
    prompts:
      - Sicken anyone in contact with them
      - Fend off an attack with the threat of toxin
      - Deliberately attack with the poison
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Venomous
    desc: >
      //"My arrows can fly farther than its spit." -- Woody

      Poison is not selective. It will harm anyone, friend or foe.

      Some poisons have antidotes, or may not penetrate some kinds of defense.
      For example, a snake's fangs might be deflected by armor.

      Being Venomous does not pose a challenge
      if the source or effectiveness of the poison is negated.

      Venomous beings may:
    prompts:
      - Inadvertently harm allies, or themselves if they are not immune
      - Lose the harmful quality if it's concentrated in fangs, weapons, etc. that are lost
      - Fail to harm something or someone with a natural or acquired immunity
- front: &Zombie
    <<: *tfront
    name: Zombie
    desc: >
      //"This unholy abomination will fall!" -- Emory

      The being is undead, or one of the living dead.

      Necromancy, curses, or strange phenomena
      can bring a deceased creature back to a false life.
      The being is not sustained by biology, but magic.
      Some zombies are mindless, while others are disturbingly cunning.
      Either way, they are inherently frightening as reminders of mortality.

      Zombies may pose a challenge by being horrifying, grotesque, or unnaturally durable.

      Zombified beings may:
    prompts:
      - Ignore attacks or effects that only affect the living
      - Sustain more damage than normal before being defeated
      - Infect those they harm with a plague or sickness
  back:
    <<: *tback
    name: Zombie
    desc: >
      //"Not so much fell as fell apart..." -- Basler

      Being sustained by dark magic, the undead are equally vulnerable to it.

      Many zombies cannot abide holy objects, places, or effects.
      Others are bound by orders to only guard a certain place,
      or do a certain thing.

      Zombified beings may:
    prompts:
      - Weaken or expire in the presence of the sacred
      - Fall prey to tricks or traps a thinking being could avoid
