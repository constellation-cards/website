      Oracle cards can answer questions. Draw one card for a simple answer, or two cards for a complex one.
      Use these cards to answer what someone is feeling, or what emotion a thing or event would spark.
      Each emotion has two neighbors. You can use the emotion itself, or choose to mix it with a neighbor.
    rule: Flip to reveal an answer
