- front: &Boulevard
    <<: *neighborhood-front
    name: The Boulevard
    desc: >
      A Boulevard is where the city's artistic and aesthetic
      offerings connect with individual citizens.
      Shops, eateries, arcades, and more offer visitors
      chances to spend their money and their time.

      A flourishing Boulevard boasts big crowds.
      The neighborhood attracts tourists and locals alike
      by offering a variety of sights, sounds, and smells.
    prompts:
      - What are some of the notable sights and attractions?
      - What sort of crowds are found here?
      - Does the crowd change due to time of day, season, etc.?

      A Boulevard is where the city's artistic and aesthetic
      offerings connect with individual citizens.
      Something is lacking,
      whether a supply of attractions to experience
      or a demand for them from the populace.

      A struggling boulevard lacks a healthy crowd of visitors.
      Whether fallen from former glories,
      or built around a nucleus of hope and ambition,
      it's not giving people a reason to come right now.
    prompts:
      - How new is the Boulevard compared to the rest of the city?
      - What emotions do visitors feel when they see the state of things?
      - Is anyone trying to attract new visitors?
      - Is anyone trying to stop them?
- front: &Harbor
    <<: *neighborhood-front
    name: The Harbor
    desc: >
      A Harbor is the home of trade and travel, to and from the city.
      It is often a visitor's first introduction to the city.
      Commercial transports, whether caravans, trains, or zeppelins,
      are found everywhere here.

      A flourishing Harbor is the life and breath of a city.
      Anything people need or want that isn't obtained locally
      must be brought from somewhere else, and it all comes through the Harbor.
    prompts:
      - What kinds of vehicles or technology move people or cargo here?
      - What is the experience of someone coming here? Of leaving?
      - What are some of the trading partners or destinations represented here?
      - Are other cultures and their visitors mostly found here, or do they inhabit the rest of the city?

      A Harbor is the home of trade and travel, to and from the city.
      It is often the last sight a regretful traveler sees before leaving.
      Commercial transports, whether caravans, trains, or zeppelins,
      are uncommon or sometimes found in states of neglect.

      A struggling Harbor is doing its best to keep the city afloat.
      Whether conditions are bad here, or whether the city's trading partners
      have fallen on hard times (or abandoned it),
      all the neighborhood can do is keep moving whatever's left.
    prompts:
      - What kinds of transportation vehicles or technology were or are found here?
      - Did the city let its trading partners down, or the other way around?
      - What things are in short supply because of the situation?
      - Who could provide them? Why aren't they?

- front: &Temple
    <<: *neighborhood-front
    name: The Temple
    desc: >
      The Temple is devoted to the spiritual and religious elements of the city
      and its inhabitants. It might be a single colossal church,
      a network of holy places for every faith,
      or tiny shrines to tiny gods scattered across the city.

      A flourishing Temple attracts a faithful flock.
      Worshippers come to pray, to donate, and to find their inner selves.
      Priests, wise men, and perhaps actual spirits may intercede
      to help troubled souls or provide advice.
    prompts:
      - What belief system or systems are practiced here?
      - Are beliefs or practices divided along social lines such as wealth, species, or neighborhood?
      - How has faith affected the city for good? For ill?

      The Temple is devoted to the spiritual and religious elements of the city
      and its inhabitants.
      It might be a disgraced or amoral mega-church,
      a collection of squabbling rival churches,
      or the remnants of an older and forgotten belief system.

      A struggling Temple has been abandoned by its flock.
      The city as a whole might consider faith a dead end or a scam.
      The priests and leaders may have become corrupt or greedy,
      or simply have lost faith in their own institutions.
      If there are real gods, it's even possible they have abandoned the city.
    prompts:
      - What belief system or systems were practiced here?
      - What motive, such as greed, corruption, or apathy, stands against them?
      - How has a lack of faith helped the city? Hurt the city?
