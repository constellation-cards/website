What now?\" -- Basler\nThis encounter includes something important that is heavily defended.\nThis could mean body armor of leather or metal, hardened barriers of stone, or wood, a protective aura of magic, a divine blessing, or something else.\nYou may be challenged if you try to penetrate or circumvent the armor to get to what's inside.\nSomething armored may:\n","prompts":["Ignore harm from typical weapons or other sources of damage","Destroy weaker things that strike it or are struck by it","Protect unarmored allies"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Armored","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"You know what metal does? Heats up. Fireball!\" -- Tana\nEvery armor has a weakness or comes at a cost, like making someone slower or something heavier. Some armor has weak spots or is vulnerable to a specific attack. Armor can also suffer if not regularly maintained.\nYou can confront an Armored obstacle without a challenge if you can find and exploit one of these weaknesses.\nSomething armored may:\n","prompts":["Have limited senses that can be exploited by nimble, stealthy, or evasive opponents","Be forced to shed the armor if it's heated, if they sink, etc.","Be susceptible to area-effect attacks or those of a particular type (magic, psychic, electric, etc.)"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Base","front":{"name":"Base","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Aheheh.. We come in peace?\" -- Basler\nThe encounter includes a place where creatures stay for a common purpose.\nA Base can be a temporary encampment, an outpost, a secret headquarters, a wild animal's den, or some other protected space.\nYou may be challenged if you try to find something specific in the base, find your way out or through, or confront its occupants and their preparations.\nA Base may:\n","prompts":["Bristle with defenders","Defy intrusion with traps, labyrinthine structure, or other clever preparations","Enable its defenders to cut off escape routes or easily give chase"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Base","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Next time, I'll let my sword do the talking.\" -- Emory\nWhile Bases can be big and imposing, their nature can work against their occupants.\nTents, side-passages, stacked crates, and many other things can help a character even the odds. Camps have a lot of supplies that can be looted or bargained for.\nA Base may:\n","prompts":["House something you're looking for, or something unexpected that can help you","Rely on infrastructure that can be destroyed or disrupted","Give up secrets about the plans and activities of its occupants"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Diabolical","front":{"name":"Diabolical","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Back, foul fiend! Light will overcome you!\" -- Emory\nA Diabolical encounter has the touch of evil. An actual summoned demon, a possessed victim, or a dark and malevolent force are all Diabolic.\nYou may be challenged if you engage with the Diabolical without proper protections or if you unknowingly encounter its influence.\nA Diabolical encounter may:\n","prompts":["Seek to corrupt or influence the vulnerable","Exploit moral weaknesses or dark secrets","Expose its true nature and hellish powers"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Diabolical","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Basler, stop cringing. He's not talking about you.\" -- Woody\nEvil hasn't won, though it keeps trying. Powers from beyond are bound by their own rules too, and can be defeated accordingly.\nCharacters who arm themselves with occult lore or divine blessings may circumvent or neutralize a Diabolical power.\nA Diabolical encounter may:\n","prompts":["Be susceptible to folk incantations or rituals","Recoil from the pure of heart","Flee to fight another day"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Elemental","front":{"name":"Elemental","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Earth sprites. They have the ore we seek.\" -- Tana\nThis encounter involves powerful elemental forces. This can mean creatures made of such forces, or dangerous sources like a volcano or a violent storm.\nYou may be challenged by the raw power of an Elemental threat, or it can cause environmental dangers or obstacles.\nAn Elemental power may:\n","prompts":["Create, animate, or manipulate its element in useful or dangerous ways","Change the environment with aspects of its element, such as making rivers of fire or barriers of wind","Control or manipulate its element, even inside complex or living things, like the metal in electronics or the water in blood"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Elemental","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"They had some nice gemstones too!\" -- Basler\nThe elements represent a complex system with rules that can be exploited.\nEach element is usually weak to another element, such as fire being weak to water. Elements are also bound to their natures. Fire needs some sort of fuel to persist, for example.     \nYou can weaken or neutralize an Elemental threat by exploiting its vulnerabilities or using its nature against it.\nElemental threats may:\n","prompts":["Be vulnerable to their element's normal vulnerabilities or rules","Require a nearby source of the element to control, or just to survive"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Flying","front":{"name":"Flying","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Did something just swoop overhead?\" -- Emory\nThis encounter includes an important aspect that can fly or is otherwise airborne.\nWinged creatures, skilled magicians, and others can fly. Floating platforms, mischievous winds, and more can keep important assets or dangers aloft.\nYou may be challenged when a flying threat holds your object out of reach, or when you try to affect something in the sky.\nFlying threats may:\n","prompts":["Strike targets on the ground without risking counterattacks","Move faster than those trapped on the ground, or reach places they can't","See greater distances or from better angles"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Flying","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Meet my best girl, Annette! A net, get it?\" -- Basler\nWings require lots of energy to sustain flight, and are often fragile. Magical or elemental sources of flight can be counter-spelled or negated. Turbulent air can thwart flyers, forcing them to ground, where they might be vulnerable.\nYou may avoid the challenge of a flyer by disturbing its source of flight or forcing it into situations where its flight won't help.\nFlying threats may:\n","prompts":["Become entangled, trapped, or confined in ways that negate flight","Be unable to lift heavy loads or fly under difficult conditions","Suffer great harm if they fall a great distance"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Gang","front":{"name":"Gang","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"They outnumber us 5 to 1, folks!\" -- Basler\nThis encounter includes a group of people or creatures bound together in common purpose.\nGangs can be organized, like criminal gangs or military units, or they can be informal groups, like angry mobs or startled herds of animals.\nYou may be challenged by a Gang's numerical advantage, or by its planning and influence.\nA Gang may:\n","prompts":["Surround or isolate individuals through strength in numbers","Shout down or bully a lone voice","Bring a variety of skills or resources to bear on a problem"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Gang","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Sounds like fair odds to me. Have at you!\" -- Emory\nThe strength of a gang is in its numbers. Dealing with individual members can be very different from confronting the gang as a whole.\nWhile an assembled gang acts instinctively, individuals can be made to consider actions more carefully.\nYou may avoid or circumvent the challenge of a gang by disrupting the group, or by addressing individual members.\nA Gang may:\n","prompts":["Have competing impulses or mixed sympathies or agendas","Fall apart if a leader is weakened or shamed","Follow a new leader or impulse that better matches its agenda"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Hybrid","front":{"name":"Hybrid","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"A Gryphon. The heraldic symbol of my kingdom. Majestic!\" -- Emory\nA Hybrid being is made up of two or more things, not always living.\nSuch beings can be part-human (mermaids, harpies), mixed animal (cockatrices, pegasi), shapeshifters (werewolves), or weirder (tree-ogres).\nA Hybrid may pose a challenge if characters are unfamiliar with the combination.\nHybrid beings may:\n","prompts":["Use the best of their combined abilities","Use different abilities together in some unique way","Reveal a surprising new ability"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Hybrid","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"That thing was terrifying! Your kingdom is messed up!\" -- Basler\nNot every hybrid has a perfect command of its own nature. Hybrids must also obey the rules of all their component parts.\nA Hybrid may not pose a challenge if the characters exploit its weaknesses.\nHybrid beings may:\n","prompts":["Suffer the vulnerabilities of any of their contributing parts","Become confused by conflicting impulses or instincts"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Large","front":{"name":"Large","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"The bigger they are, the harder they fall!\" -- Tana\nThis encounter includes something of enormous size. It might be naturally large, like a dragon or a giant, or have been enlarged by magic or other forces.\nYou may be challenged if you can't overcome your diminutive size relative to a Large threat.\nA Large threat may:\n","prompts":["Resist human-scale attacks or effects","Reach or hit an entire area at once","Deal devastating damage to smaller creatures and objects"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Large","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Just as long as it doesn't fall on us.\" -- Basler\nYou may have trouble engaging with a Large encounter due to the size difference, but that trouble goes both ways. It can be hard for Large things to perceive or target smaller foes.\nYou may counter the challenge of a Large encounter by  exploiting your respective sizes somehow.\nA Large threat may:\n","prompts":["Lose track of small details or targets","Be easily targeted due to its size","Move slowly or clumsily"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Monstrous","front":{"name":"Monstrous","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"That ain't no ordinary wolf, folks..\" -- Basler\nMonstrous threats are altered forms of the familiar. They are fiercer, more feral, or disturbingly unnatural.\nThe characteristics of a mundane thing become exaggerated and gruesome. Muscles knot and bulge. Jaws elongate and bristle with vicious fangs. Hide thickens and goes patchy. All is as seen through the lens of nightmare.\nYou may be challenged by a Monstrous threat's adaptations, or by its relentless aggression.\nMonstrous threats can:\n","prompts":["Lash out savagely","Use their adaptions to overwhelm the unprepared","Terrify onlookers with their awful nature"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Monstrous","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Whoever corrupted this creature will pay. Let's press on.\" -- Woody\nA Monstrous threat is powered by its rage or aggression, but those can be its downfall as well.\nMonstrous creatures often lack a sense of self-preservation, fighting relentlessly when others would retreat.\nYou may avoid the challenge of a Monstrous threat by taking advantage of its twisted, feral nature.\nMonstrous threats may:\n","prompts":["Lose themselves in their own ferocity","Fall into traps when skillfully goaded","Misunderstand those not driven by similar instincts"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Notorious","front":{"name":"Notorious","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"That's Gretamaw, the Beaked Butcher!\" -- Basler\nThis encounter includes someone or something that bards sing about.\nA Notorious monster whispered of by fearful villagers. A place of power that most folks avoid. An artifact of legend, replete with arcane power. A person known for great or terrible deeds.\nYou may be challenged by the weight of Notorious reputation, by those who follow or worship it, or by the very power that made it famous.\nNotorious things may:\n","prompts":["Impress or intimidate you with their presence","Live up to the legend in a big way","Reveal some unexpected or unreported ability"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Notorious","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Save the beak. We need it to claim the reward!\" -- Basler\nFame has its price.\nIf the stories that have gotten around are accurate, you might know how to take on this encounter - maybe.\nSometimes tales are false, and notorious things prove to be very different than you expect.\nYou may avoid the challenge of a Notorious threat when you correctly leverage its lore, or when you look at it with fresh eyes and discover the truth behind the stories. \nNotorious threats may:\n","prompts":["Behave or react just as the legends say","Draw unwanted attention to themselves in the region","Hold a deeper, unsung truth"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Portentous","front":{"name":"Portentous","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Where are all those crows going?\" -- Tana\nThis encounter foreshadows something important. It can be a mystical experience, laden with dreams and prophecy, or just a mundane glimpse into a momentous reality beyond.\nOminous encounters not only foretell change, but confront a character with a question: are you ready for what comes next?\nPortentous encounters may:\n","prompts":["Give a taste of things to come","Force people into hard moral or personal choices","Subtly mingle the mundane and the symbolic or dreamlike"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Portentous","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"They're going the same way we are. Come on.\" -- Woody\nThe Portentous is the first step on a larger road. It both surprises characters, and prepares them for what is next.\nYou may avoid the challenge of Portentous encounters by meeting the future they suggest with your eyes open.\nPortentous encounters may:\n","prompts":["Reveal an important clue or suggest a strategy","Unlock a hidden strength or personal conviction"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Spectral","front":{"name":"Spectral","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"My arrows go right through it.\" -- Woody\nThis encounter includes something ghostly or purely spiritual.\nSpectral entities might have obligations or passions binding them to the mortal world. They may be frightened, angry, or confused. They might wish to go - or stay.\nYou may be challenged by a Spectral threat if you can't interact with it, or if its otherworldly nature has dangerous effects.\nA Spectral threat may:\n","prompts":["Pass through solid matter or people","Wield morbid magics like chilling touch or possession","Ravenously pursue something the living have that it wants"],"rule":"Flip to see ways to meet the encounter's challenges."},"back":{"name":"Spectral","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"I'll have a magic circle up in a moment!\" -- Tana\nSpectral beings came to the waking world for a reason, whether for mischief, malice, or other needs. The bonds holding them to life are tenuous, and if they're given what they want, or can no longer get it, they might be forced back.\nSpectral encounter may not pose a challenge if their objective is obtained, threatened, or destroyed. A Spectral threat may:\n","prompts":["Be forced back into the other world by applying arcane lore","Be weakened or repulsed by warding rituals","Make a compromise to achieve its objective"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}},{"name":"Tense","front":{"name":"Tense","tags":["encounter"],"desc":"//\"Deep breaths.
