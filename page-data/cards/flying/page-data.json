A net, get it?\" -- Basler\nFlight often comes with drawbacks or complications of its own.\nWings require lots of energy to sustain flight, and are often fragile. Magical or elemental sources of flight can be counter-spelled or negated. Turbulent air can thwart flyers, forcing them to ground, where they might be vulnerable.\nYou may avoid the challenge of a flyer by disturbing its source of flight or forcing it into situations where its flight won't help.\nFlying threats may:\n","prompts":["Become entangled, trapped, or confined in ways that negate flight","Be unable to lift heavy loads or fly under difficult conditions","Suffer great harm if they fall a great distance"],"rule":"Flip to see ways the encounter challenges the PCs."}}]}}}
