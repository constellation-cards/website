Cygnus the swan, Orion the hunter, Canis Major, the Big Dipper. Our eyes see the stars, but our imagination supplies the pattern.</p><p>This is a role-playing game (RPG) that uses cards, such as 3&quot;x5&quot; index cards. You will need a printed set of the cards that come with the game. You will also want a supply of blank cards, and something to write with. The game is ideally played by 3-6 people, but it can support any number of players, even solo play.</p><p>The cards supply rules for handling characters, challenges, combat, and so on.

Following the agenda when you speak will help keep the game moving forward. The game provides cards five agenda cards, summarized below. You can use these agenda cards as written, adapt them, or create your own.</p><p>The <strong>principal</strong> narrates the actions of a specific <em>principal character (PC)</em>. PCs are the viewpoint characters and protagonists of the story you create.</p><p>The <strong>facilitator</strong> is responsible for managing the <em>spotlight</em>, which is a metaphor for whose narration is in focus at the moment. As a facilitator, you ensure that everyone&#x27;s voice is heard.</p><p>The <strong>loremaster</strong> answers questions about the fictional world, its inhabits, history, and details. As a loremaster, you make sure the players understand what the characters would know about their world.</p><p>The <strong>referee</strong> clarifies rules questions or constructs rules to adjudicate situations mechanically. As a referee, you make sure everyone agrees on how to use the mechanics of the game.</p><p>The <strong>storyteller</strong> narrates for <em>ensemble characters (ECs)</em>, also called non-player characters (NPCs). As a storyteller, you narrate for all ensemble characters, interacting with the PCs and helping drive the story forward.</p><p>In many other tabletop roleplaying games, there is a Dungeon Master (DM) or Game Master (GM). If you want to have a GM run the game, that person will be responsible for all the non-principal agendas, and every other player is a principal. Otherwise, each player can make use of any of these agendas any time it makes sense.</p><h1 id="using-the-cards" style="position:relative"><a href="#using-the-cards" aria-label="using the cards permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Using the Cards</h1><p>The game uses both sides of its cards.

Sometimes it&#x27;s the same name for both sides (for example, &quot;Guardian&quot;) sometimes not (for example, &quot;Hurt/Wounded&quot;). Cards have types, indicated by symbols.

Player characters happen when you pick three character cards, for example. Encounter cards exist to give you random situations to confront. You can mix the emotional Oracle cards with other types of cards to suggest a feeling.</p><p>There are other ways to use this rule. For example, you can create character arcs for individual PCs. Have each PC pick one of their character cards, or draw one at random. Pair these with another PC&#x27;s cards for a story about those characters. Or pair them with an emotion card to suggest a feeling for a story.</p><p>If you&#x27;ve got plot cards already created, pair them with a PC&#x27;s card, to suggest a specific way that the plot element comes back into play. Maybe &quot;grateful villagers&quot; comes up in combination with &quot;Dreamer&quot;, meaning an eager villager has followed the PCs from their home, inspired by a particularly idealistic PC. What will the group do about this?</p><p>You can also draw unused character cards from their stacks. For example, you might draw the Tech Focus card, and an Amazement emotion card. You could use these to tell the story of an inventor whose gadgets attract the PCs&#x27; attention, or who needs help making or recovering an important gizmo.</p><p>Sometimes, our imagination just needs a push to get started.

They&#x27;re elements of the game world, like &quot;rune magic&quot; or &quot;the dragons&quot; or &quot;the westward migration&quot;, around which character drama will revolve.</p><p>The group as a whole should decide on one or two pole stars to begin the game. This is a chance for players to suggest themes or elements that they like.</p><p>By the end of the first session of play, each player should know their PC&#x27;s position toward each pole star. For example, Tana wants to learn rune magic, while Woody mistrusts it. Basler is curious about it, but Emory is ignorant of it. You can decide on positions during session zero, or discover how your PC feels as you play them.</p><p>Pole star positions shouldn&#x27;t put PCs into direct conflict with each other. If one person wants to kill dragons and another wants to protect them, the party may fall apart the first time they encounter a dragon! In this case, pick a new pole star, or new positions. However, some disagreement is not only acceptable, but encouraged. The purpose of pole stars is to drive drama, even between your PCs.</p><p>If every character has a very similar position toward a given pole star, pick a new pole star. For example, If everyone thinks dragons are cool and should be protected, pick a new pole star that&#x27;s related to dragons, like &quot;dragon tamers&quot;. If you come up with a cool thing to include in the world, but it doesn&#x27;t work as a pole star, that&#x27;s okay! Include it anyway.</p><h2 id="example-pole-stars-and-positions" style="position:relative"><a href="#example-pole-stars-and-positions" aria-label="example pole stars and positions permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Example pole stars and positions</h2><p>(Protect, manipulate, befriend, get help from) the young prince</p><p>(Join, resist, investigate, distrust, infiltrate) a major religious order</p><p>(Research, exploit, explore, warn the world about) the elemental imbalance</p><h1 id="creating-player-characters" style="position:relative"><a href="#creating-player-characters" aria-label="creating player characters permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Creating Player Characters</h1><p>You can create a character by choosing character cards, as well as a name, a history, friends and family, and other parts of an identity.

The point of a Face is to turn a &quot;what&quot; (like the Empire in Star Wars) into a &quot;who&quot; (like Darth Vader). Characters can&#x27;t interact with religions, social movements, or governments, but they can interact with characters who represent or embody those things.</p><p>The Face&#x27;s actions should reflect not only their own personality, but the nature of what they represent. Likewise, it should be possible for characters to change the intangible by affecting the Face.</p><p>It&#x27;s possible for a complex situation to need multiple Faces, each one representing one aspect of the situation.

Something is at stake, or there&#x27;s a question that needs answering, or a situation has become complicated, and PC choices are how we resolve it. A scene ends when the players are satisfied with the new state of affairs, or can&#x27;t find any further way to act on the situation. Typical scenes would include exploration, investigation, personal interactions, overcoming obstacles, or combat.</p><p>For example, the PCs want to extract a prisoner from a dungeon. They play through a few scenes, answering questions like &quot;can we get in without being spotted&quot; and &quot;how do we get the prisoner safely out&quot; during each scene.</p><p>The resolution of a scene should create a new driver to kick off the next scene. If this doesn&#x27;t happen, the group should decide how to proceed, or ask questions about the situation until a new driver suggests itself. If the driver is invalidated somehow during the scene, follow the change if possible.</p><p>For example, say that the prisoner has been freed. Perhaps the group is now being pursued by dungeon guards or bounty hunters, and must find ways to evade pursuit. And once that&#x27;s done, where does the group go next? You as players might ask questions like &quot;now that the prisoner is out, what do they want to do next?&quot; or &quot;did the prisoner overhear anything important while in the dungeon?&quot;</p><p>On the other hand, if the prisoner has been secretly collaborating with their &quot;captors&quot;, maybe the PCs must now determine the reason for the betrayal, and survive their own escape from the dungeon.</p><p>The way to resolve drivers in a scene is for players to <strong>pose challenges</strong>, and for characters to <strong>meet those challenges</strong>.</p><p>Example drivers for a scene:</p><ul><li>We need to reach the castle to warn the king</li><li>What&#x27;s the chieftain really planning?</li><li>We have to escape the dungeon</li><li>Why were these villagers rounded up for arrest?</li><li>We want to find an old adventurer who knows about this amulet</li><li>Which of these three spirits can we trust?</li><li>We&#x27;re trying to locate a farmer&#x27;s lost sheep in a dangerous forest</li><li>Can we get across the mountain pass in time?</li><li>We need to scout the area for bandits</li><li>What does the dragon want in exchange for the sapphire?</li></ul><h1 id="creating-scenes" style="position:relative"><a href="#creating-scenes" aria-label="creating scenes permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Creating Scenes</h1><p>When you want to create a scene, but you aren&#x27;t sure where to begin, you can use the Universal Rule. Put some cards together and interpret the results. You might pair character cards, or character and pole star cards, or any other combination that sounds interesting. You might do this at the start of the game, when nobody is sure how to start, or when the party has resolved a plot and isn&#x27;t sure where to go next.</p><p>When you are starting the game, or in the downtime between adventures, you might just create a scene where the driver is &quot;what do your characters do in their ordinary lives?&quot; The scene might follow each PC over the course of an hour or a day. Other players can ask questions about a PC&#x27;s activities. The scene ends when everyone feels satisfied with the outcome.</p><h2 id="using-encounter-cards" style="position:relative"><a href="#using-encounter-cards" aria-label="using encounter cards permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Using Encounter Cards</h2><p>The game comes with a set of Encounter cards, which you can use to create random encounters. This might mean traveling pilgrims, monsters the party must fight or avoid, or dangers to be overcome.</p><p>To create a scene using these cards, draw two Encounter cards, then draw one Emotion card. The emotion will indicate the dominant feeling you want the encounter to evoke in the players or characters. The Encounter cards will give you some initial ideas about what to describe, as well as prompts that you can use to guide the scene and challenges to pose to the players.</p><p>You should use the PCs&#x27; character cards and pole star positions to create encounters in which the characters have a personal investment or interest.</p><p>If the cards you drew don&#x27;t seem to spark any ideas, it&#x27;s okay to draw replacements. However, it&#x27;s often better to try and make do with what you have. Be creative, and interpret the cards broadly.</p><h2 id="example-encounter" style="position:relative"><a href="#example-encounter" aria-label="example encounter permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Example Encounter</h2><p>Say that you draw the Flying, Hybrid, and Vigilance cards for a scene on the road in a fantasy world. Here are a few ways to interpret this combination:</p><p>First, there&#x27;s a flying creature with a hybrid nature, like a gryphon (with an eagle&#x27;s head and wings, and a lion&#x27;s body), that&#x27;s flying over the countryside, keeping a close eye on things. It might be a wild creature (perhaps guarding a nest?), or act as the mount for a person (who&#x27;s looking for someone or something in the region). This might be a combat or stealth encounter.</p><p>Second, there might be a camp of hunters, soldiers, mages, or other experts who are monitoring hybrid flying creatures (such as gryphons) in the area. Perhaps they&#x27;ve been a menace to road travel, or perhaps a camp of hunters is trying to obtain eggs and train the young creatures as mounts. This is a social encounter, where the party must evaluate the motives of the group and decide what to do about it.</p><p>Third, there might be hybrid beings - elementally infused animals, faerie-touched human beings, or people whose limbs are partially made of plants - who are wary of flying creatures, such as territorial dragons or hunting hawks. This might be an investigative encounter, where the PCs try to understand the situation and perhaps take a side.</p><h1 id="characters" style="position:relative"><a href="#characters" aria-label="characters permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Characters</h1><p>A scene includes <strong>characters</strong>. This includes some or all of the PCs, as well as <strong>ensemble characters</strong> (ECs). Anyone speaking from the Storyteller agenda can portray ECs, or the group can decide as a whole how they&#x27;ll act. When setting up a scene, everyone in the group should understand which ECs are present. Describe their appearance and actions.</p><p>There&#x27;s one ensemble character that appears in every scene: the <strong>location</strong>. What is the time of day? Of year? How light or dark is it? What is the weather like? The terrain? Is this indoors, outdoors, or underground? You should &quot;speak&quot; for the location as a character, too. It may start raining, or the clouds may cast a shadow over someone&#x27;s face at a significant moment. The location should reflect the emotions that are driving the scene.</p><h1 id="genre-conventions-and-boundaries" style="position:relative"><a href="#genre-conventions-and-boundaries" aria-label="genre conventions and boundaries permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Genre Conventions and Boundaries</h1><p>Sometimes, we play to find out what&#x27;s going to happen next. But often, we have some kind of assumption, stated or not, about what can or can&#x27;t happen.</p><p>For example, a destructive force like army or plague threatens a peaceful village. Many players would be uncomfortable if this actually happens. The group should respect that feeling. The way to respect it is to change the drivers for the scene. For example, we can go from &quot;does the village get annihilated?&quot; to &quot;what does it cost to save the village from annihilation?&quot; The challenge of trying to stop the event will be plenty exciting (and dangerous), without bringing up what might be a dark or triggering outcome.</p><p>Some situations might be narrative dead-ends. If the PCs stay in a dungeon for years, the game grinds to a halt, for example. You can change drivers like &quot;do we escape the dungeon&quot; into &quot;how do we escape the dungeon&quot; to handle this. The PCs might encounter a prisoner who has a way out but needs their help to enact it. A hostile force might invade the dungeon, helping free the PCs in the confusion. Earthquakes or flooding might damage the dungeon itself, permitting escape through chaotic conditions. You can assume the escape, and still make a situation dangerous and exciting.</p><h1 id="challenges" style="position:relative"><a href="#challenges" aria-label="challenges permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Challenges</h1><p>When you hear any player narrating something their PC is doing and think “it would be reasonable and interesting if that didn’t work the way you want”, pose a challenge to that player. Give them an alternative outcome, what you think <em>might</em> happen instead, then let them tell you how they meet that challenge. If what they say doesn’t immediately make you think “yeah, that’d work”, ask them to flip a Character card or take a Condition.</p><p>You can flip a Character card from front to back to meet challenges. You must explain how the situation ties back to the theme of the Character card and its prompts. For example, if you are escorting a prisoner out of a dungeon and are challenged along the way, you might say &quot;because I&#x27;m a Guardian, I can keep my charge safe from something&quot;, then flip that card to the back side. You can&#x27;t flip Mercantile in this situation, except perhaps by bribing a guard.</p><p>If you don&#x27;t have a Character card available, or one that can reasonably be applied to the situation, you can also draw or pick a Condition card, or escalate a Condition you already have. Other rules might allow you to meet challenges in other ways. For example, you might say &quot;the guards shoot arrows, and I&#x27;ll take the Hurt Condition by being hit in place of the prisoner&quot;.</p><p>Condition cards can also impose challenges when you take actions that the condition would affect. For example, if you are Undergeared, you might not be able to set up your camp in dangerous territory. If you are Exhausted, any sort of travel might pose a challenge.</p><p>Sometimes, you want to flip a card because you feel it gives legitimacy to your action. This is okay!

For example, if one player poses a challenge like &quot;the guards might spot you and raise the alarm&quot;, and another poses a challenge like &quot;the guards might spot you and attack&quot;, you don&#x27;t need to meet two challenges. If you don&#x27;t meet it, the players who posed the challenges should decide amongst themselves which outcome to enact.</p><p>However, the same action might pose multiple challenges. For example, if you attack a Flying Armored dragon, you must overcome the fact that it&#x27;s both Flying (by having a ranged weapon, or by striking when it dives at you) and Armored (its scales are tough, and you must either find a weak spot or have a powerful weapon). In addition, if you have the Weakened Condition, you might need to overcome that challenge too.</p><p>In this case, you can use a mixture of Character and Condition cards to meet the challenge. For example, you might say &quot;as a Soldier, I stand up when everything says to stand down&quot; to overcome Weakened, then &quot;I wait for the dragon to dive at me, then spear it up close. In doing so, I get knocked away like a rag doll and my spear shatters&quot;. This lets you take the Hurt and Undergeared Conditions, thus meeting the challenge.</p><h1 id="failure-and-complication" style="position:relative"><a href="#failure-and-complication" aria-label="failure and complication permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Failure and Complication</h1><p>It&#x27;s possible to not meet a challenge, if you don&#x27;t have an applicable Character card and don&#x27;t want to take a Condition. In that case, whoever posed the challenge gets to narrate their proposed alternative outcome. For example, when escaping a dungeon, a player might pose a challenge like &quot;the guards attack your group and the prisoner is wounded&quot;.</p><p>Nobody likes to feel like they failed. But sometimes, a setback can do more good than harm. Aside from its impact on the story, there are mechanical benefits to failing.</p><p>You can pose a challenge to another player, and your alternative can flip back one or more Character cards if the challenge isn&#x27;t met. For example, say that Tana&#x27;s Magic card and Basler&#x27;s Secrets card are both flipped. Woody is readying an arrow to attack an enemy wizard from hiding. Tana&#x27;s player offers a challenge: &quot;you shoot, but the wizard has a spell of reflection, and a magically glowing arrow darts right back at you, showing your position to their comrades.&quot;</p><p>This means Woody doesn&#x27;t get to succeed at the attack, but narration satisfies two conditions: &quot;fall prey to a side effect or curse&quot; and &quot;give yourself away at an inopportune moment&quot;. If Woody&#x27;s player accepts this outcome, Tana and Basler get to flip their cards back - useful for the upcoming fight!</p><p>If it&#x27;s important to the player to the succeed, they can also choose to take a Condition card that matches the narration. For example, Woody&#x27;s player might say &quot;I&#x27;ll take the Hurt condition, as the arrow arcs back and strikes me&quot;.</p><h1 id="ending-a-session" style="position:relative"><a href="#ending-a-session" aria-label="ending a session permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Ending a Session</h1><p>As you play, your characters will develop.

Any character can be brave, but the character with Courage has bravery as an explicit part of their story. But stories change.</p><p>At the end of each session, you can do one of two things.</p><p>First, you can <strong>trade</strong> one Character card out for a different one. You aren&#x27;t limited to trading out the same type of card for another one. For example, a Solitary character who has learned to cherish and protect their new friends might pick the Guardian card and discard Solitary. This doesn&#x27;t mean your character has lost their abilities or experiences, only that they aren&#x27;t as important to their story now.</p><p>Second, you can <strong>add</strong> a new Character card. You can pick an existing card, or create a unique card. This might be a new power or skill you acquired, a boon companion who now travels with you, a special item you now carry, a blessing or benefit you&#x27;ve secured, or anything else that&#x27;s happened to you during the game.</p><h1 id="creating-plot-cards" style="position:relative"><a href="#creating-plot-cards" aria-label="creating plot cards permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Creating Plot Cards</h1><p>As a group, you can create one or more &quot;plot cards&quot;. Like Character cards, they are intended to represent plot beats or story elements. Unlike Character cards, they can be used by every player in the game.</p><p>Plot cards can use the same rules as a Character card - flip to get a hit, flip back when a complication is narrated. For example, the PCs rescue a village, and intend to return there again in the future. They might create a Plot card, usable when they need something from the village, with complications arising when someone from the village comes to them for help in return.</p><p>You might want different rules for other Plot cards. For example, the party might obtain a favor from the Queen. Once they use this favor (to meet a challenge, perhaps), the card is discarded, and the PCs must earn another favor if they want the relationship to continue.</p><p>Plot cards can be edited later, or discarded, based on the dictates of the story. For example, if the Queen withdraws her favor, the party can&#x27;t use that Plot card. On the other hand, perhaps the Queen&#x27;s cousin lived incognito in a village the PCs save from destruction, and she becomes a reliable ally. In that case, the rule on the Plot card might change from &quot;discard on use&quot; to something else.</p><h1 id="revisiting-pole-stars" style="position:relative"><a href="#revisiting-pole-stars" aria-label="revisiting pole stars permalink" class="anchor before"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Revisiting Pole Stars</h1><p>The players and their characters will discover new things they care about in the campaign.
